Fine system using PEFCL

Thanks for using my script! This is super simple and is just a fine system for you city. The Officers can issue them and will get copies to keep for records!

**Add this to Ox_Inventory/data/items.lua**
```
	['ticket'] = {
		label = 'Ticket',
		weight = 100,
		stack = false
	},
```

If you need ANY help or support follow link below and we will get you sorted out!
